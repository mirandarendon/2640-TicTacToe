# CS2640 - Tic Tac Toe MIPS Assembly
##### Eulalia Pedro Andres, Miranda Rendon, Marlene Salcido

## Features

- 3x3 game board rendered with bitmap display
- **One-player mode**: Play against a basic CPU opponent
- **Two-player mode**: Take turns locally with a friend
- Win and draw detection logic
- Keyboard input for navigation and move selection

## How It Works

- Players take turns placing X or O on the board using keyboard input.
- In one-player mode, the user plays as X and the CPU places O using a random move generator.
- In two-player mode, users alternate turns as X and O.
- The game checks for win/draw conditions after each move and resets automatically.
